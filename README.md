#PROJECT NAME: Reddit Clone
#WIREFRAME: https://www.figma.com/file/HCQHzPauw7vf0o1G7pCspR/Reddit-Clone?node-id=0%3A1

This project is a clone of the popular Reddit, a network of communities where people can dive into their interests, hobbies, and passions, developed in MERN. 

That is:
Mongoose for the database
Express for the backend
